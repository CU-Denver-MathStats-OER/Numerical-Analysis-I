    "In this chapter, we will study the following problem: given data $(x_{i},y_{i}),i=0,1,...,n$,\n",
    "find a function $f$ such that $f(x_{i})=y_{i}.$ This problem is called the interpolation problem, and $f$ is called\n",
    "the interpolating function, or interpolant, for the given data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Interpolation is used, for example, when we use mathematical software to plot a smooth curve through discrete data points, when we want to find the in-between values in a table, or when we differentiate or integrate black-box type functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "How do we choose $f$? Or, what kind of function do we want $f$ to be? There are several options. Examples of functions used in interpolation are polynomials, piecewise polynomials, rational functions, trigonometric functions, and exponential functions. As we try to find a good choice for $f$ for our data, some questions to consider are whether we want $f$ to inherit the properties of the data (for example, if the data is periodic, should we use a trigonometric function as $f$?), and how we want $f$ to behave between data points. In general $f$ should be easy to evaluate, and easy to integrate \\& differentiate.\n",
