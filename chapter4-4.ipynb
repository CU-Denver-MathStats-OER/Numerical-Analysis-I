    "As we observed in Section [](section4.2), a polynomial interpolant of high degree can have large oscillations, and thus provide an overall poor approximation to the underlying function. Recall that the degree of the interpolating polynomial is directly linked to the number of data points: we do not have the freedom to choose the degree of the polynomial.\n",
    "\n",
    "In spline interpolation, we take a very different approach: instead of finding a single polynomial that fits the given data, we find one low-degree polynomial that fits every **pair** of data. This results in several polynomial pieces joined together, and we typically impose some smoothness conditions on different pieces. The term **spline function** means a function that consists of polynomial pieces\n",
