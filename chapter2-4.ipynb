If $p_1\\notin (a,b)$, then we will not accept $p_1$ as the next iteration: instead the code will switch to the bisection method, determine which subinterval among $(a,p_0),(p_0,b)$ contains the root, updates the interval $(a,b)$ as the subinterval that contains the root, and sets $p_1$ to the midpoint of this interval. Once $p_1$ is obtained, the code will check if the stopping criterion is satisfied.  If it is satisfied, the code will return $p_1$ and the iteration number, and terminate. If it is not satisfied, the code will use Newton's method, with $p_1$ as the initial guess, to compute $p_2$. Then it will check whether $p_2\\in (a,b)$, and continue in this way.
