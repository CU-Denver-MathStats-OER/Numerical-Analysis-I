    "Gaussian elimination involes identifying a pivot position (the $(i,i)$ poisition on the diagonal) at each step, multiplying the row where pivot is by a separate factor, and subtract it from each row below. Note that no zeros were encountered in the Gaussian elimiation processes in the two examples above, and hence such Gaussian elimination is called \"naive\". In addition, if echelon form, instead of reduced echelon form, is obtained from Gaussian elimination, a **back substitution** algorithm is needed to solve the upper-triangular system for $x$'s from bottom to top. The back substitution algorithm solves for $x_n$ from the last equation, $x_{n-1}$ from the second to last equation, and all the way up, until $x_1$ is solved for from the first equation. The following code performs back subsitution for an upper triangular system, and the solution to the system is stored in place in $\\boldsymbol{b}$."

    "To improve the stability of Gaussian elimination, pivots should be as large as possible, so that multipliers are as small as possible. The reason is that multiplying the row where the pivot is by a large multiplier and adding the product to another row will \"overwhelm\" the latter by losing significant information due to finite precision. There are various strategies to place large numbers at the pivot positions. One idea is to compare the absolute values of the pivot and all numbers below it, and the row where the largest number in magnitude is located is swapped with the row where pivot is, if they are not the same row. This variant of Gaussian elimination is called Gaussian elimination with partial pivoting. The algorithm is summarized below."
